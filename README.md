# interview

This is a project for interview purpose.

## Environment Requirement

The computer must have the NodeJs environment and the version must be greater than V11.16. Because I use a feature for reading input from cli. It starts from V11.16. see: https://nodejs.org/api/readline.html#readline_rl_symbol_asynciterator

## How to run it

Go to the root directory of this project and run "node interview.js". Input the start position and end position, the path will be displayed. Or you can input "test" to see all the paths.
